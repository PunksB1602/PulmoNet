Research Project Plan (Bachelor → PhD Track)
Project Title (Draft)

"Self-Supervised Learning for Chest X-ray Disease Detection with Explainable AI"

1. Research Goals

Apply self-supervised learning (SSL) on chest X-ray datasets.

Fine-tune models for disease classification.

Add explainability methods (e.g., Grad-CAM, SHAP) to visualize decisions.

Compare SSL vs traditional supervised learning.

This gives you both novelty (SSL in medical imaging) and practical relevance (explainability for clinicians).

2. Datasets (Free & Public)

CheXpert (Stanford) – 224,316 chest X-rays, 14 disease labels.

MIMIC-CXR – ~370k chest X-rays with radiology reports (requires data use agreement).

👉 Start with CheXpert (easier setup), then scale to MIMIC-CXR if time allows.

3. Methods & Tools
(a) Baseline Supervised Model

Model: DenseNet121 or ResNet50 (pretrained on ImageNet).

Train on labeled CheXpert data.

Metric: AUC (Area Under Curve) for each disease.

(b) Self-Supervised Pretraining

Methods: SimCLR, BYOL, or MAE (Masked Autoencoders).

Train on unlabeled chest X-rays (you can ignore labels at first).

Then fine-tune on disease labels.

(c) Explainability

Use Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++ to visualize which parts of the X-ray influenced predictions.

Optionally compare with SHAP or LIME.

(d) Evaluation

Compare Supervised vs SSL + Fine-tuning.

Measure: Accuracy, AUC, F1-score.

Qualitative: Do heatmaps align with radiologist annotations?

4. Timeline (6–8 months)

Month 1–2: Preparation

Learn PyTorch/TensorFlow + medical imaging basics.

Set up dataset (CheXpert).

Reproduce a baseline classification model.

Month 3–4: Self-Supervised Learning

Implement SimCLR / BYOL or use libraries like PyTorch Lightning Bolts.

Pretrain on unlabeled chest X-rays.

Month 5–6: Fine-Tuning & Explainability

Fine-tune on disease labels.

Add Grad-CAM visualizations.

Compare results vs supervised baseline.

Month 7–8: Writing & Publication Prep

Write paper (6–8 pages, IEEE/MICCAI style).

Submit to:

MICCAI Workshop (Medical Imaging AI), or

IEEE ISBI (Biomedical Imaging), or

arXiv preprint + GitHub repo.

5. Expected Outcomes

A working model that detects diseases from chest X-rays.

Visualization tool (heatmaps for doctors).

A research paper draft (even workshop-level counts a lot for PhD).

A strong portfolio project (GitHub + arXiv) for applications.

6. Stretch Goals (Optional if time allows)

Use MIMIC-CXR reports → do multimodal learning (image + text).

Try federated learning (simulate training across multiple hospitals).

Experiment with diffusion models for synthetic X-rays.

👉 If you execute even the basic version (supervised vs SSL + explainability), that’s already enough for a solid bachelor thesis + PhD application booster.

Would you like me to also create a sample structure for your research paper (sections + what to write in each) so you can directly start drafting?

so how to begin

Great question 🎯 — the beginning is the hardest part of any research project. Let’s break it into concrete first steps so you can start smoothly:

🚀 How to Begin Your Research Project
Step 1 – Learn the Essentials (2–3 weeks)

Before touching research code, get comfortable with:

Deep learning frameworks: PyTorch (recommended).

Medical imaging basics: What chest X-rays are, how labels work (pneumonia, edema, etc.).

Paper reading: Skim a few relevant papers (e.g., CheXNet, SimCLR, BYOL).

📚 Resources:

Fast.ai or PyTorch tutorials.

Papers: CheXNet (Stanford, 2017), SimCLR (Google, 2020).

Step 2 – Set Up Your Environment (1 week)

Install Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook.

If you don’t have a GPU:

Use Google Colab Pro / Kaggle Notebooks (free GPU for small projects).

Or cloud credits (AWS/GCP often give student credits).

Step 3 – Get the Dataset (2–3 weeks)

Start with CheXpert (small version) → 224k X-rays, free download.
🔗 CheXpert Dataset

Organize into train/val/test splits.

Write simple PyTorch DataLoader to load X-rays.

👉 Goal: Be able to load an X-ray and display it in Python.

Step 4 – Build a Baseline (1 month)

Train ResNet50 or DenseNet121 (ImageNet-pretrained) on CheXpert labels.

Evaluate with AUC score.

Save baseline results → this is your reference.

Step 5 – Add Self-Supervised Learning (2 months)

Pick one SSL method (start with SimCLR).

Pretrain on unlabeled CheXpert images.

Fine-tune on labels → compare with baseline.

Plot performance improvement.

Step 6 – Add Explainability (2–3 weeks)

Implement Grad-CAM / Grad-CAM++.

Visualize which lung regions influenced predictions.

Show side-by-side: original X-ray vs heatmap.

Step 7 – Write + Share (1–2 months)

Draft research paper (Intro, Method, Experiments, Results, Conclusion).

Upload code to GitHub.

Upload preprint to arXiv.

(Optional) Submit to IEEE ISBI / MICCAI workshops.

✅ First 3 Things You Should Do Right Now

Install PyTorch + Jupyter Notebook.

Download the CheXpert small dataset.

Run a notebook to load and display one chest X-ray image.

👉 Once you’ve done this, you’re officially started 🚀

Do you want me to give you a starter notebook/code that loads CheXpert X-rays and trains a simple CNN baseline, so you can kick off immediately?
